# Portfolio Web Page

## What Is This Project?

This is a simple responsive web page containing navigation bar that provides quick acess to different sections on the page, images with links for each project or app, and sections with key info. As I am developing my portfolio, most of the images wcurrently act as placeholders and navigate to google.com

## What Is The Objective?
My objective is to demonstrate a portfolio of my coding work samples.

## Instructions

Follow the detailed instructions below if you want to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages. They were originally provided to me by Trilogy Education Services, LLC, a 2U, Inc. brand.

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!
